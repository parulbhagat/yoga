<p>Yoga is derived from the word 'yuj' . In Vedic Sanskrit it means "to add", "to join", "to unite", or "to attach". It is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline that originated in India.

<p><span>"Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. This tradition is 5000 years old. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfilment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day."</span>
